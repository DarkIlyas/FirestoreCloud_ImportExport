# FirestoreCloud_ImportExport
Import/Export a json file into Firestore cloud  


You need four files , better put them in one folder for easier imports: 
  - serviceAccount.json : you get it from Project Overview > Project settings > Service account > Generate new private key and rename it serviceAccount.json
  - your json database file
  - config.js
  - import.js
  
Finally , run node import.js
